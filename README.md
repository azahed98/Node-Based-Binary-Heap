# Node-Based-Binary-Heap
This is an implementation of a binary heap using nodes as opposed to the conventional array.
There is a heavy lack of comments, but it probably works just as you expect. The only strange thing is the use of bitwise operators to check for powers of 2 (to figure out which branch to go to when navigating the heap).
